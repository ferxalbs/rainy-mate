"When developing code, always follow these principles:

- Modularize components: Break down functionality into small, reusable, and independent modules
- Ensure maintainability: Write code that is easy to understand, modify, and extend in the future
- Follow best practices: Apply clean code principles, proper naming conventions, and consistent formatting
- Document clearly: Add comments and documentation where necessary to explain complex logic
- Design for scalability: Structure the code to accommodate future growth and changes"
